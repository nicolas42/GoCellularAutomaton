# GoCellularAutomaton

This file will generate about 10 files named "CellularAutomaton<number>.png" based on what I thought were the most interesting looking cellular automaton images as illustrated here. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html

The heart of the code is in the function makeCellularAutomaton which generates an image based on a rule number, the width of the image (the height is half the width), and two colors of your choosing.

  img := makeCellularAutomaton(rule, width int, color1, color2 color.RGBA)

The images are generated by concurrent goroutines which communicate with a waitgroup to indicate when they're finished.

//
//  Example of Cellular Automaton Rule 30
// The bit pattern of 30 is "00011110"
// So the 4th, 5th, 6, and 7th patterns get a "1" below their middle value.
// "111" "110" "101" "100" "011" "010" "001" "000"
//   0     0     0     1     1     1     1     0
// This continues until the bottom of the image

//	bugfix 8-mar-2016
//	defer outFile.Close() changed to outFile.Close()
// 	"too many open files" error
//	deferred calls are only executed when the function exits.

// Tried using goroutines to speed it up with some success.
// At first I just put the writePNG function in a goroutine.
// This reduced execution time to about 75% of what it was which was nice.
// After this I tried putting the whole thing into goroutines using the sync library
// This proved even better even on a macbook pro with only 2 cores.
